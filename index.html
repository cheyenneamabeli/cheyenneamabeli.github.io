		<p>Hello, and Welcome to my portfolio, most of my portfolio consists of random projects that I have done, in addition to my internship work. I am currently looking to get a job as a Front End Web Developer! I graduated in May 2020 from Kent State University. I am looking for any experience I can get and let it take me wherever. I am a very hard worker and devote myself to my job.</p>
