	<h2>Released from College</h2>
	<p>This week is my last week in college, I have three more exams to complete and then saturday I graduate. I am very excited, but also very nervous. It kind of sucks that for my senior year we have been in quarantine, but I am more nervous about what this means for a job for me. Its been hard trying to find anything in terms of a long term job. I did just have an interview though and I have to take a test for them to see if I am qualified. For the most part I have been either working or staying inside. I do breif trips outside to walk my dogs, but even with quarantine lifting I know there is going to be a second wave so I am not risking it and I am just going to wait until theres a vaccine or it has gone away.</p><br><br>
	<h2>A Day in the Life of Quarantine</h2><br>
	<p>Lets face it quarantine is very boring, I still have both my jobs and I am still very bored. Today I only worked one job for a couple hours that was slow, most the time we spend it on our phones or playing board games. When I first woke up I walked my dogs and played some pranks on my boyfriend. These are very harmless becasue i try to constantly find places to hide and see if i can scare him most the time i get a what are you doing. I am also running out of places to hide since our apartment is small.</p>
	<p>Then we both play our nintendo switches we played Animal Crossing. Then stared at the walls some, not really we took a nap, becasue what else is there to do. Other then that I worked and did my homework for the day and finished the week. My dogs are currently laying on my feet more so they are trapping my feet and I cannot move for fear of death upon me. Quarantine has made me even more dramatic which no one has thought was possible since I am already a dramatic person.</p>
	<p>Here is a video on facts about Animal Crossing!</p>
